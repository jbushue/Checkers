# Checkers
Simple 1v1 checkers game written in c++

The History of Checkers:

The first Checkers-like playing board was discovered by archaeologists in a dig in Mesopotamia (now Iraq) in the city of Ur.
Carbon dating showed the board to be from about 3000 BCE, or more than 5000 years old.
While the rules of Mesopotamian Checkers are unknown, historians do know the rules of an ancient Egyptian Checkers game called Alquerque.
This game may have originated about 1400 BCE, and was popular until the Middle Ages.
In 1100 CE, a new version of Checkers, Fierges, was invented by a Frenchman.
This version, played on a chess board, was generally played by women (much as Mah Jong is played today).
Around 1500, the first books were written about the game which was now called Draughts.
In 1847, the first Draughts and Checkers championships were played with formal awards given.
Changes were made to the rules because advanced players gained an advantage by playing first.
More tweaks to the rules helped make the game more consistent across locations and playing situations.


How to Play Standard American Checkers:

Game Basics-
*Checkers is played by two players. Each player begins the game with 12 colored discs.
*(Typically, one set of pieces is black and the other red.)
*Each player places his or her pieces on the 12 dark squares closest to him or her.
*Black moves first. Players then alternate moves.

*The board consists of 64 squares, alternating between 32 dark and 32 light squares.
*It is positioned so that each player has a light square on the right side corner closest to him or her.

*A player wins the game when all of the opponent's pieces have been captured.

Rules of the Game-
*Moves are allowed only on the dark squares, so pieces always move diagonally. Single pieces are always limited to forward moves (toward the opponent).

*A piece making a non-capturing move (not involving a jump) may move only one square.

*A piece making a capturing move (a jump) leaps over one of the opponent's pieces, landing in a straight diagonal line on the other side.
*Only one piece may be captured in a single jump

*When a piece is captured, it is removed from the board.

*When a piece reaches the furthest row from the player who controls that piece, it is crowned and becomes a king.

*Kings are limited to moving diagonally but may move both forward and backward.
*(Remember that single pieces, i.e. non-kings, are always limited to forward moves.)
